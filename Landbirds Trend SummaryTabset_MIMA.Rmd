<h3> Long-term forest bird monitoring program </h3>

<p> The Northeast Temperate Network's (NETN) breeding bird monitoring program has been implemented since 2006 in partnership with the <a href="https://vtecostudies.org/">Vermont Center of Ecostudies</a> and many volunteer birders. The program was established to determine status and trends in species diversity and the abundance of breeding landbirds in the park. </p>

Bird monitoring at `r params$Park` includes a combination of sites located in areas that are primarily forested (24) or within open field, grassland (6) habitats. However, given the proximity of the sites to one another, most species detected are similar in both habitats suggesting that our sites are monitoring a similar bird community. For instance, no grassland obligate breeders have been detected in the grassland/open field sites and of the `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park])` species detected, the only 2 species detections unique to the grassland/open-field sites are actually of forest breeding species. For this reason some of the summary analyses presented in this report include data from forested and the grassland/open field sites while some analyses such as the Bird Community Index and network-level trend analysis were restricted to monitoring data for species that breed within forested habitats. The Bird Community Index was developed strictly for measuring the health of the forest bird community and the trend analysis utilized NETN's forest vegetation monitoring data to evaluate effects of forest structure on the bird community. We lack similar vegetation data near our grassland monitoring sites and an analysis specific to the grassland birds is forthcoming.  

<p>This report summarizes monitoring results between `r params$minYear` and `r params$maxYear` in `r getParkNames(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park], name.class = "long")` (`r params$Park`) for the following topics:</p>
<ul>
 <li> <b>Bird Diversity:</b> A summary of the number of species detected since `r params$minYear` across all monitoring sites located in grassland/open field and forested habitats.</li> 
 <li> <b>Bird Community Index:</b> A summary of the condition of the park's forest bird community.</li> 
 <li> <b>Species Trends:</b> A summary of bird abundance over time for the most commonly detected forest-breeding species . </li> 
 <li> <b>Conclusions</b>: A summary of bird monitoring results in the context of park forest health. </li>
 <li> <b>Supporting Resources:</b> List of references and associated documentation for the bird monitoring program.</li> 
 </ul>

<br>
<h3>Methods</h3>

<p> The analyses in this report are based on repeated visits to  permanent monitoring sites shown in the map to the right. Each point is typically visited once a year but occasionally twice during the peak breading season from late spring to mid summer. At each visit all birds heard or seen during a 10-minute period are recorded. Additionally, the observers indicate an approximate distance to the bird. For detailed information on the methods and analysis, please consult the Supporting Resources. </p>

<p> If you have questions about this program, report, or would like to acquire data or speak about bird monitoring in your park please contact NETN staff  <a href="mailto:ed_sharron@nps.gov"> Ed Sharron (Bird Volunteer Coordinator)</a>,  <a href="mailto:adam_kozlowksi@nps.gov"> Adam Kozlowski (Data Manager)</a>, or <a href="mailto: aaron_weed@nps.gov"> Aaron Weed (Program Manager)</a>.</p>

### Bird Diversity {.tabset }

<p>  The number of detected species (or species richness) is a key metric from our monitoring because it provides a straight-forward indication of the bird diversity using `r params$Park` as breeding habitat during the summer. The number of species may change over time due to many factors affecting the local area surrounding the park (e.g., weather, habitat type, vegetation composition) or factors affecting bird populations at greater geographic scales, such as trends in regional forest structure (Holmes and Sherry 2001), land use, and wintering habitat survival. <b> The following summaries were derived from sites within the park's forest and open, grassland sites </b>.</p>


#### No. of Species Over Time

<p> <b>There are three main take-home messages related to bird diversity from our monitoring thus far: </b> </p> 
<ul>
<li> At `r params$Park`, a total of `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park])` bird species have been detected between `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear` with an average of `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park], byYear = TRUE) %>% dplyr::pull(Richness) %>% mean() %>% round(0)` species detected per year <b> across forested and grassland sites </b> (Figure 1, blue). It is likely that not all species encountered during monitoring breed within the park but the number breeding is close to the observed average species richness. Species richness at our `r params$Park` sites ranks #3 among the 10 NETN parks included in the analysis (Figure 2) but it is important to note that we monitor grassland/open field habitats at MIMA and SARA in addition to our forested sites where in most parks we only monitor forests. </li>
<p>
<li> The average number of species detected each year has remained <b> unchanged </b> between `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear` in `r params$Park` (Figures 1 and 3). It is important to note that in any given year the number of <i>estimated</i> species as shown in Figure 1 (green) may be lower or higher than the actual number detected during monitoring (blue) because the model accounts for imperfect detection (e.g., bird is present but not heard or seen) and effects of forest structure. In many years the trend model (Figure 1, green) estimated more species than observed but overall the majority of field observations fall within the confidence intervals (gray shading). </li> 
<p>
<li> `r params$Park` is one of 4 `r params$network` parks showing a very small  (but non-significant) increase in estimated species richness over time (Figure 3). </li>
</ul>

Note that this plot is not showing the total number of bird species in the park  since other bird species may be present that were not detected during monitoring."}

<p> While no formal analysis has been completed, this map shows that cumulative species richness appears to be slightly lower at most of, but not all (e.g., Site 1302), sites along the southern boundary. </p>

### Bird Community Index {.tabset }

<p> The Bird Community Index (BCI; O'Connell et al. 1998, 2000) is an index designed to indicate the conservation status (or “health”) of the bird community in forested areas such as those in `r params$network` parks. It was developed for conservation of forest birds common within the Central Appalachian region but our analyses indicate that it is also applicable to and helpful for characterizing breeding birds in `r params$network` parks because of the similarity of species. To calculate the BCI, the list of bird species from each site is considered separately. If a site has many bird species that are dependent upon intact forest areas during breeding (&quot;forest obligates&quot;) the site gets a high score, whereas birds that live in a variety of areas (&quot;generalists&quot;) give a site a low score.</p>

<p> Many factors are used to assess the
degree to which a bird species is a generalist or a forest obligate. These
include: </p>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>What habitat does the species prefer?</li>
 <li>Is the species restricted to the interior of forests?</li>
 <li>Where does the species nest (trees, shrubs, ground, etc)?</li>
 <li>What does the species eat (insects in bark, insect on the ground, omnivore, etc)? </li>
 <li>Is the species a predator or parasite of other bird's nests?</li>
 <li>Is the species exotic?</li>
 <li>Is the species a park resident year-round or does it migrate?</li>
 <li>How many broods does the species raise per year?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Based on these assessments each survey site is assigned a BCI score. The scores are then averaged for the entire park in each year.
This average score is used to categorize the bird community of the park as either Low, Medium, High, or Highest Integrity. </p>

#### BCI Over Time

Figure 4 shows that the BCI rating at `r params$Park` has remained relatively unchanged since `r params$minYear` and is of "Medium Integrity" compared to other bird communities within the Central Appalachian region. A score of Medium Integrity at `r params$Park` is not surprising given the surrounding land-use and forest health history and is due to the presence of generalist species, exotic species (e.g., European Starling, House Sparrow), brood parasites (e.g., Brown-headed Cowbird), and a relatively small diversity of interior forest obligates (but many are present).

#### BCI Across Monitoring Sites
Bird Community Index ratings for permanent monitoring sites from `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear` are shown below across `r params$Park`. BCI scores are mostly rated as Medium Integrity across the park with a few sites rated as Low Integrity (5 of 23).

```


#### BCI Compared to Other NETN Parks

As of `r params$maxYear`, `r params$Park` has the lowest BCI rating in `r params$network` (Figure 5). An analysis concluded that trends in overall bird abundance seem to be declining the fastest in parks with the highest BCI rating (Doser et al. 2021) (Figure 6).

### Species Trends {.tabset}

Monitoring the status and trends of breeding birds in `r params$network` parks is a primary objective for the program. We assess population status and trends based on the abundance of each species detected over time. The tabs below illustrate the status and trends of the most common species encountered in `r params$Park`, <b> however, a few species primarily detected in or associated with grassland/open field sites (e.g. Tree Swallow) were <u> excluded from the trend analysis </u> since they do not breed in forested habitats.</b> Trends were calculated for species that are closely associated with forested habitats such as forest edge, scrub, wetlands, and open woodlands and that we could evaluate their abundance in the context of the surrounding forest habitat. Please see Doser et al. (2020) for further details of why certain species were excluded from the trend analysis.

As of 2019 no obligate grassland breeders have been detected at `r params$Park` and while 2 species have been detected only within the grassland/open field sites as compared to the forest sites, they are not grassland/open field habitat breeders (Back-and-white Warbler, Turkey Vulture). The fact that many forest breeders are heard at the grassland/open field sites, and that many of the same species are detected in both habitats, suggests that our sites are monitoring a similar community of birds.

#### Relative Abundance

<p> Relative abundance, expressed as the average of the maximum number of birds detected per site per year from `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear`, provides an indication of how often a particular species is observed during monitoring and reflects its population status in the park. Figure 7 shows that the most common species detected at `r params$Park` is a mix of species common to our region and of conservation importance. </p>

<p> Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs) are ecologically distinct regions in North America with similar bird communities <a href="https://www.nabci-us.org/"> (www.nabci-us.org)</a>. `r params$Park` is located within the `r params$BCRName` BCR. Within this region, species of regional conservation importance have been designated based on rankings by Partners in Flight (Panjabi et al. 2020). 

<strong> Fourteen species of regional conservation concern within the `r params$BCRName` BCR have been detected at `r params$Park` </strong>, including Barn Swallow, Black-and-white Warbler, Black-billed Cuckoo, Blue-winged Warbler, Canada Warbler, Chipping Sparrow, Chimney Swift, Common Grackle, Eastern Wood-Pewee, Northern Flicker, Rose-breasted Grosbeak, Scarlet Tanager, Wood Thrush, and Yellow-billed Cuckoo. Of these, 4 are among the 20 most abundant species detected (Figure 7)! </p>

Data summaries exclude species not suspected to be breeding in the park (e.g., flyovers) and include species detected in forested and grassland/open field sites. Relative abundance is calculated as the maximum number of detections per species among visits to all sites in a year divided by the total number of sites monitored from `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear`.

Figure 8. Estimated trends in abundance between 2006 to 2019 of the top 10 most common species detected at `r params$Park` from Doser et al. (2021). The rank order of abundance in the park is denoted in parentheses following the species name. Trend estimates represent the average change in abundance on the <b> log scale</b> of a species per site every <b> four years</b>. Percentage values in the plot represent the associated average percent change in abundance every 4 years for trends that are statistically significant. For example, American Crow abundance has declined about 19% every 4 years between `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear`. </p>
</div>

##### <b>Top 10 Most Abundant Species at `r params$Park` </b>

<p> Figure 8 shows the trend estimates between `r params$minYear` and `r params$maxYear` for the top 10 most abundant species in `r params$Park` based on a model using time to first detection within the 10-minute point count (Doser et al. 2021). Average population size has not changed since `r params$minYear` for 9 of the most commonly detected species (e.g., trend estimate error bars overlap zero) but the detections of 8 of these species appear to be declining. American Crow is the only common species that has declined significantly while Red-winged Blackbird detections are increasing (but not significantly). Refer to Figure 10 in the "Plots of Species Abundance" section to see annual counts over time for the common species. </p>

<p> Of the 4 commonly detected species at `r params$Park` that are of regional importance, the relative abundance of Scarlet Tanager, Wood Thrush and Common Grackle has remained the same since `r params$minYear` but over this time period we have observed significant increases in Eastern Wood-Pewee (see section "All Species Trends"). This is encouraging news since most of these species are in decline regionally.</p>
<p>

##### <b>Trends Across NETN Parks </b>

<p> Trends in the abundance of all species combined across the network has not changed since 2006 (Figure 9a) but the trend varied widely across parks (Figure 9b). For instance, the abundance of all species combined has declined in 3 parks (ACAD, MABI, and MORR) while in SARA, ROVA, and WEFA it has increased over time. Abundance of all species detected in SAGA and MIMA remained the same during this time period. </p>

<p> In parks with significant decreasing or increasing trends, most species generally showed a similar trend to the overall park trend, but often only a fraction of the species-specific trends were significantly different from zero. For example, while the trend analysis indicated that  28 species are in decline at `r params$Park`, only 1 (American Crow) has declined significantly since `r params$minYear` (Figures 8 and 9c). It is important to acknowledge declines in relative abundance even for species with trends that were non-significant because changes in the abundance of rare or less commonly detected species are usually less likely to show statistically significant trends in monitoring data yet are of conservation interest. Hence, lack of statistical significance does not mean that we shouldn't be concerned about species we are seeing fewer of over time -- our methods may not be sensitive enough to detect statistically significant changes. </p>

Comparisons of NETN monitoring data for the top 10 most abundant species in `r params$Park` to the results available from the BBS suggest that trends in park-scale abundance are somewhat consistent with trends at the `r params$BCRName` BCR-scale and state-scale (4 of 8 species). Declining trends in abundance, regardless of whether they are significant or not, of Blue Jay, American Robin, American Crow, and Black-capped Chickadee are consistent across `r params$Park` and BCR- and state-scales as is the non-significant increase in Gray Catbirds. Decreases in Northern Cardinals and White-breasted Nuthatches observed at the park, but not at the other scales, is notable.

Figure 11. Relationship between average number of birds of a single species per site (y-axis) and (a) tree basal area, (b) percent forest within a 1km radius around each site, and (c) forest regeneration. Site-level basal area and regeneration were estimated from NETN's long term forest health monitoring program (Tierney et al. 2017) and % Forest from the 2011 National Land Cover Database (Homer et al. 2015).
