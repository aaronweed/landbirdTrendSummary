<h3> Long-term forest bird monitoring program </h3>

<p> The Northeast Temperate Network's (NETN) breeding bird monitoring program has been implemented since 2006 in partnership with the <a href="https://vtecostudies.org/">Vermont Center of Ecostudies</a> and many volunteer birders. The program was established to determine status and trends in species diversity and the abundance of breeding landbirds in the park. </p>

<p>This report summarizes forest bird monitoring results between `r params$minYear` and `r params$maxYear` in `r getParkNames(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park], name.class = "long")` (`r params$Park`) for the following topics:</p>
<ul>
 <li> <b>Bird Diversity:</b> A summary of the number of species detected since `r params$minYear` across all monitoring sites.</li> 
 <li> <b>Bird Community Index:</b> A summary of the condition of the park's forest bird community.</li> 
 <li> <b>Species Trends:</b> A summary of bird abundance over time for the most common species. </li> 
 <li> <b>Conclusions</b>: A summary of bird monitoring results in the context of park forest health. </li>
 <li> <b>Supporting Resources:</b> List of references and associated documentation for the bird monitoring program.</li> 
 </ul>

<br>
<h3>Methods</h3>

<p> The analyses in this report are based on repeated visits to  permanent monitoring sites shown in the map to the right. Each point is typically visited once a year but occasionally twice during the peak breading season from late spring to mid summer. At each visit all birds heard or seen during a 10-minute period are recorded. Additionally, the observers indicate an approximate distance to the bird. For detailed information on the methods and analysis, please consult the Supporting Resources. </p>

<p> If you have questions about this program, report, or would like to acquire data or speak about bird monitoring in your park please contact NETN staff  <a href="mailto:ed_sharron@nps.gov"> Ed Sharron (Bird Volunteer Coordinator)</a>,  <a href="mailto:adam_kozlowksi@nps.gov"> Adam Kozlowski (Data Manager)</a>, or <a href="mailto: aaron_weed@nps.gov"> Aaron Weed (Program Manager)</a>.</p>

### Bird Diversity {.tabset }

<p>  The number of detected species (or species richness) is a key metric from our monitoring because it provides a straight-forward indication of the bird diversity using `r params$Park` as breeding habitat during the summer. The number of species may change over time due to many factors affecting the local area surrounding the park's forest (e.g., weather, forest cover, understory vegetation) or factors affecting bird populations at greater geographic scales, such as trends in regional forest structure (Holmes and Sherry 2001) and wintering habitat survival. </p> 


#### No. of Species Over Time

<p> <b>There are three main take-home messages related to bird diversity from our monitoring thus far: </b> </p> 
<ul>
<li>  At `r params$Park`, a total of `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park])` bird species have been detected between `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear` with an average of `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park], byYear = TRUE) %>% dplyr::pull(Richness) %>% mean() %>% round(0)` species detected per year (Figure 1, blue). It is likely that not all species encountered during monitoring breed within the park but the number breeding is close to the average species richness. Some of the species detected are breeding in non-forested areas surrounding our sites (e.g., Bobolink). Species richness at `r params$Park` ranks as #4 among the NETN parks monitored (Figure 2).</li>
<p>
<li> The number of species has remained <b> unchanged </b> between `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear` in `r params$Park` (Figures 1 and 3) but there is a suggestion of a decline. It is important to note that the number of <i>estimated</i> species as shown in Figure 1 (green) may be higher in some years than the actual number detected during monitoring (blue) because not all birds may have been detected during the survey due to imperfect detection (e.g., bird is present but not heard or seen). The model describing species richness over time at `r params$Park` seems adequate because most of the monitoring data is contained within the confidence intervals (gray area around) surrounding the trend.</li> 
<p>
<li> While the number of forest bird species in `r params$Park` has not changed, it is one of 4 `r params$network` parks showing a slight (but non-significant) decline over time (Figure 3). </li>
</ul>

Other bird species may be present in the park that are not detected during monitoring."}

<p> While no formal analysis has been completed, this map shows that the cumulative species diversity is fairly uniform across the majoirty of the 25 sites at the park. A higher diversity has been observed at one site located right next to the Pogue and along our MABI South route. </p>

### Bird Community Index {.tabset }

<p> The Bird Community Index (BCI; O'Connell et al. 1998, 2000) is an index designed to indicate the conservation status (or “health”) of the bird community in forested areas such as those in `r params$network` parks. It was developed for conservation of forest birds common within the Central Appalachian region but our analyses indicate that it is also applicable to and helpful for characterizing breeding birds in `r params$network` parks because of the similarity of species. To calculate the BCI, the list of bird species from each site is considered separately. If a site has many bird species that are dependent upon intact forest areas during breeding (&quot;forest obligates&quot;) the site gets a high score, whereas birds that live in a variety of areas (&quot;generalists&quot;) give a site a low score.</p>

<p> Many factors are used to assess the
degree to which a bird species is a generalist or a forest obligate. These
include: </p>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>What habitat does the species prefer?</li>
 <li>Is the species restricted to the interior of forests?</li>
 <li>Where does the species nest (trees, shrubs, ground, etc)?</li>
 <li>What does the species eat (insects in bark, insect on the ground, omnivore, etc)? </li>
 <li>Is the species a predator or parasite of other bird's nests?</li>
 <li>Is the species exotic?</li>
 <li>Is the species a park resident year-round or does it migrate?</li>
 <li>How many broods does the species raise per year?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Based on these assessments each survey site is assigned a BCI score. The scores are then averaged for the entire park in each year.
This average score is used to categorize the bird community of the park as either Low, Medium, High, or Highest Integrity. </p>

#### BCI Over Time

Figure 4 shows that the BCI rating at `r params$Park` has remained relatively unchanged since `r params$minYear` and is consistently within the "High Integrity" category meaning that the species diversity is comparable to a bird community within a healthy forest within the Central Appalachian region. 

<div style="float:right;position:relative;top:10px;padding:1px 1px 1px 1px;margin:0px 5px 10px 5px">

```

</div>

#### BCI Across Monitoring Sites
Bird Community Index ratings for permanent monitoring sites from `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear` are shown below across `r params$Park`. BCI scores are fairly uniform across the park sites and mainly rated as High Integrity (68% of sites). This indicates that multiple forest specialist species (residents and migratory) are breeding across most of the park's forest. 

```{r figcap, echo=F, results = 'hide'}
map_figcap <- paste0("Map of Bird Community Index ratings for permanent monitoring sites in ", params$Park, " from ",  params$minYear, " to ", params$maxYear, ".

  addLayersControl(overlayGroups = "Stands", options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE))
```


#### BCI Compared to Other NETN Parks

As of `r params$maxYear`, `r params$Park` has the 2nd highest BCI rating in `r params$network` (Figure 5)! Our recent analysis concluded that trends in overall bird abundance are declining the fastest in parks with the highest BCI rating (Doser et al. 2021) (Figure 6). We are still examining why this may be so, but this pattern is likely to be related more to regional factors rather than factors operating at the park-scale.

### Species Trends {.tabset}

Monitoring the status and trends of breeding birds in `r params$network` parks is a primary objective for the program. We assess population status and trends based on the abundance of each species detected over time. The tabs below illustrate the status and trends of the most common species encountered in `r params$Park`.

#### Relative Abundance

<p> Relative abundance, expressed as the average of the maximum number of birds detected per site per year from `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear`, provides an indication of how often a particular species is observed during monitoring and reflects its population status in the park. Figure 7 shows that the most common species detected at `r params$Park` is a mix of species common to our region and of conservation importance. </p>

<p> Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs) are ecologically distinct regions in North America with similar bird communities <a href="https://www.nabci-us.org/"> (www.nabci-us.org)</a>. `r params$Park` is located within the `r params$BCRName` BCR. Within this region, species of regional conservation importance have been designated based on rankings by Partners in Flight (Panjabi et al. 2020). 

<strong> Sixteen species of regional conservation concern within the `r params$BCRName` BCR have been detected at `r params$Park` </strong>, including Black-and-white Warbler, Belted Kingfisher, Bobolink, Black-throated Blue Warbler, Chimney Swift, Eastern Wood-Pewee, Least Flycather, Mourning Warbler, Nashville Warbler, Northern Flicker, Northern Parula, Purple Finch, Rose-breasted Grosbeak, Scarlet Tanager, Veery, and Wood Thrush. Of these, 5 are among the 20 most abundant species detected (Figure 7)! </p>

Figure 8. Estimated trends in abundance between 2006 to 2019 of the top 10 most common species detected at `r params$Park` from Doser et al. (2021). The rank order of abundance in the park is denoted in parentheses following the species name. Trends estimates represent the average change in abundance on the <b> log scale</b> of a species per site every <b> four years</b>. Percentage values in the plot represent the associated average percent change in abundance every 4 years for trends that are statistically significant. For example, Blue Jay abundance has declined by about 20% every 4 years between `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear`. </p>

##### <b>Top 10 Most Abundant Species at `r params$Park` </b>

<p> Figure 8 shows the trend estimates between `r params$minYear` and `r params$maxYear` for the top 10 most abundant species in `r params$Park` based on a model using time to first detection within the 10-minute point count (Doser et al. 2021). Average population size has not changed since `r params$minYear` for species when trend estimate error bars (credible intervals, C.I.) overlap zero (e.g. Scarlet Tanager). Refer to Figure 10 in the "Plots of Species Abundance" section to see annual counts over time for these species. </p>

<p>None of the 10 most abundant birds detected in `r params$Park` have increased significantly over time since `r params$minYear` but Scarlet Tanager, Black-throated Green Warbler, and Black-capped Chickadee have stable breeding populations in the park. Alarmingly, 7 of the most abundant species at `r params$Park` have declined significantly since monitoring began including Eastern Wood-Peewee, which is a species of regional conservation importance, and Vermont's state bird, the Hermit Thrush. Most of the common species in decline are associated with intact, contiguous healthy forests with considerable mature forest structure and all are migratory species except Black-capped Chickadee and Blue Jay.
<p>

##### <b>Trends Across NETN Parks </b>

<p> Trends in the abundance of all species combined across the network has not changed since 2006 (Figure 9a) but the trend varied widely across parks (Figure 9b). For instance, the abundance of all species combined has declined in 3 parks (ACAD, MABI, and MORR) while in SARA, ROVA, and WEFA it has increased over time. Abundance of all species detected in SAGA and MIMA remained the same during this time period. </p>

<p> In parks with significant decreasing or increasing trends, most species generally showed a similar trend to the overall park trend, but often only a fraction of the species-specific trends were statistically significantly. For example, while the trend analysis indicated that 50 species are in decline at `r params$Park`, 41 of the 58 species that we were able to estimate trends from have not declined significantly since `r params$minYear` (Figure 9c). Declines in relative abundance are important to acknowledge even for species with trends that were non-significant in our study. This is because changes in the abundance of rare or less commonly detected species are usually less likely to show statistically significant trends in monitoring data yet are of conservation interest. Hence, lack of statistical significance does not mean that we shouldn't be concerned about species we are seeing fewer of over time -- our methods may not be sensitive enough to detect statistically significant changes. Continued monitoring is needed to determine whether the trends continue. </p>

<p> In `r params$Park`, the abundance of most species between `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear` appears to be in decline (Figure 9b and c). The overwhelming majority of species showing a decline at `r params$Park` is concerning, but species-specific trends need further evaluation since for some species declines may occur due to natural forest succession (Holmes and Sherry 2001) whereas others may be negatively impacted by mortality during migration or human-caused stressors such as forest fragmentation and invasive species. The significant declines of Ovenbird, Red-Eyed Vireo, and Hermit Thrush, which are our most common, highly vocal species in our region's forests,  needs further evaluation of how their populations are doing locally and regionally. Refer to the next section "Comparison to Regional Trends" to see how these species are trending at the state and BCR scales based on USGS Breeding Bird Survey data.</p>

Comparisons of NETN monitoring data in `r params$Park` to the results from the BBS suggest that species' trends in park abundance are generally consistent with trends at the `r params$BCRName` BCR- and state-scales but with a few important exceptions. Of particular importance is the discrepancy in trends of Ovenbird and Red-eyed Vireo, which are declining at the park but appear to be increasing or have stable populations at the state and BCR scales according to BBS. Both of these species are also increasing over a similar time period at monitoring sites across Vermont within the Forest Bird Monitoring Program (Faccio et al. 2017) and at Saint Gaudens NHP in Cornish, NH, which is approximately 20 miles east of MABI. Most of the other abundant species breeding at `r params$Park` are also in decline at the park-, state-, and BCR-scales and with trends of these species recorded from Vermont's Forest Bird Monitoring Program (Faccio et al. 2017), but not all. Overall, this consistency in trends across spatial scales suggests that factors affecting the status of these species are likely occurring at scales beyond the park (e.g., survival during migration, forest maturation, climate change, etc). However, the consistent decline observed since `r params$minYear` of many species at MABI and the discrepancy in trends of Ovenbird and Red-eyed Vireo to the broader region, warrants further investigation into whether park-specific factors may be important.
