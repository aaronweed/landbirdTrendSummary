<h3>Long-term bird monitoring program</h3>

<p>The Northeast Temperate Network's (NETN) breeding bird monitoring program has been implemented since 2006 in partnership with the <a href="https://vtecostudies.org/">Vermont Center of Ecostudies</a> and many volunteer birders. The program was established to determine status and trends in species diversity and the abundance of breeding landbirds in the park.</p>

Bird monitoring at `r params$Park` includes a combination of sites located in areas that are primarily forested (34) or within open field, grassland (25) habitats. Given the proximity of the sites to one another, many species are detected at sites located in both habitats. For instance, of the `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park])` species detected, only 13 species have been detected in the grassland/open-field sites while 22 are unique to the forested sites. American Robin, Common Yellowthroat, and Black-capped Chickadee are examples of species found commonly at sites within both habitats whereas Bobolink, Eastern Meadowlark, Red-winged Blackbird, and Savannah Sparrow were found primarily in open habitats. For this reason some of the summary analyses presented in this report include data from forested and grassland/open field sites while some analyses such as the Bird Community Index and network-level trend analysis were restricted to monitoring data for species that breed within forested habitats. The Bird Community Index was developed strictly for measuring the health of the forest bird community and the trend analysis utilized NETN's forest vegetation monitoring data to evaluate effects of forest structure on the bird community. We lack similar vegetation data near our grassland monitoring sites and an analysis specific to the grassland birds is forthcoming.

<p>This report summarizes monitoring results between `r params$minYear` and `r params$maxYear` in `r getParkNames(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park], name.class = "long")` (`r params$Park`) for the following topics:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Bird Diversity:</b> A summary of the number of species detected since `r params$minYear` across all monitoring sites located in grassland/open field and forested habitats.</li>

<li><b>Bird Community Index:</b> A summary of the condition of the park's forest bird community.</li>

<li><b>Species Trends:</b> A summary of bird abundance over time for the most commonly detected forest-breeding species .</li>

<li><b>Conclusions</b>: A summary of bird monitoring results in the context of park forest health.</li>

<li><b>Supporting Resources:</b> List of references and associated documentation for the bird monitoring program.</li>

</ul>

<br>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>The analyses in this report are based on repeated visits to permanent monitoring sites shown in the map to the right. Each point is typically visited once a year but occasionally twice during the peak breading season from late spring to mid summer. At each visit all birds heard or seen during a 10-minute period are recorded. Additionally, the observers indicate an approximate distance to the bird. For detailed information on the methods and analysis, please consult the Supporting Resources.</p>

<p>If you have questions about this program, report, or would like to acquire data or speak about bird monitoring in your park please contact NETN staff <a href="mailto:ed_sharron@nps.gov"> Ed Sharron (Bird Volunteer Coordinator)</a>, <a href="mailto:adam_kozlowksi@nps.gov"> Adam Kozlowski (Data Manager)</a>, or <a href="mailto: aaron_weed@nps.gov"> Aaron Weed (Program Manager)</a>.</p>

### Bird Diversity {.tabset}

<p>The number of detected species (or species richness) is a key metric from our monitoring because it provides a straight-forward indication of the bird diversity using `r params$Park` as breeding habitat during the summer. The number of species may change over time due to many factors affecting the local area surrounding the park (e.g., weather, habitat type, vegetation composition) or factors affecting bird populations at greater geographic scales, such as trends in regional forest structure (Holmes and Sherry 2001), land use, and wintering habitat survival. <b> The following summaries were derived from sites within the park's forest and open, grassland sites </b>.</p>

#### No. of Species Over Time

<p><b>There are three main take-home messages related to bird diversity from our monitoring thus far: </b></p>

<ul>

<li>At `r params$Park`, a total of `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park])` bird species has been detected between `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear` with an average of `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park], byYear = TRUE) %>% dplyr::pull(Richness) %>% mean() %>% round(0)` species detected per year <b> across forested and grassland sites </b> (Figure 1, blue). It is likely that not all species encountered during monitoring breed within the park but the number breeding is close to the observed average species richness. Total species richness at our `r params$Park` sites ranks as #1 among the 10 NETN parks included in the analysis (Figure 2) but it is important to note that we monitor grassland/open field habitats at MIMA and SARA in addition to our forested sites where in most parks we only monitor forests.</li>

<p>

<li>Although slightly increasing over time, the average number of species detected at our sites has remained <b> unchanged </b> (statistically speaking) between `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear` in `r params$Park` (Figures 1 and 3). The trend model (Figure 1, green) estimated fewer species in a couple of years but overall the species diversity detected during monitoring is very similar from year to year and most field observations fall within the confidence intervals (gray shading).</li>

<p>

<li>While the number of bird species in `r params$Park` has not changed over time, it is one of 4 `r params$network` parks showing a slight (but non-significant) increase in average species richness over time (Figure 3).</li>

</ul>

### Bird Community Index {.tabset}

<p>The Bird Community Index (BCI; O'Connell et al. 1998, 2000) is an index designed to indicate the conservation status (or “health”) of the bird community in <b> forested areas </b> such as those in `r params$network` parks. It was developed for conservation of forest birds common within the Central Appalachian region but our analyses indicate that it is also applicable to and helpful for characterizing breeding birds in `r params$network` parks because of the similarity of species. To calculate the BCI, the list of bird species from each site is considered separately. If a site has many bird species that are dependent upon intact forest areas during breeding ("forest obligates") the site gets a high score, whereas birds that live in a variety of areas ("generalists") give a site a low score.</p>

<p>Many factors are used to assess the degree to which a bird species is a generalist or a forest obligate. These include:</p>

<p>

<ul>

<li>What habitat does the species prefer?</li>

<li>Is the species restricted to the interior of forests?</li>

<li>Where does the species nest (trees, shrubs, ground, etc)?</li>

<li>What does the species eat (insects in bark, insect on the ground, omnivore, etc)?</li>

<li>Is the species a predator or parasite of other bird's nests?</li>

<li>Is the species exotic?</li>

<li>Is the species a park resident year-round or does it migrate?</li>

<li>How many broods does the species raise per year?</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>Based on these assessments each survey site is assigned a BCI score. The scores are then averaged for the entire park in each year. This average score is used to categorize the bird community of the park as either Low, Medium, High, or Highest Integrity.</p>

#### BCI Over Time

Figure 4 shows that the BCI rating at `r params$Park`'s 34 <b> forested sites </b> has remained relatively unchanged since `r params$minYear` and is of "Medium Integrity" compared to other bird communities within the Central Appalachian region. A score of Medium Integrity at `r params$Park` is not surprising given the surrounding land-use and forest health history and is due to the presence of generalist species, exotic species (e.g., European Starling, House Sparrow), brood parasites (e.g., Brown-headed Cowbird), and a relatively small diversity of interior forest obligates (but many are present).

```

#### BCI Compared to Other NETN Parks

As of `r params$maxYear`, `r params$Park` has the lowest BCI rating in `r params$network` (Figure 5). An analysis concluded that trends in overall bird abundance seem to be declining the fastest in parks with the highest BCI rating (Doser et al. 2021) (Figure 6).

### Species Trends {.tabset}

Monitoring the status and trends of breeding birds in `r params$network` parks is a primary objective for the program. We assess population status and trends based on the abundance of each species detected over time. The tabs below illustrate the status and trends of the most common species encountered in `r params$Park`, <b> however, grassland obligate breeders (e.g., Eastern Meadowlark, Bobolink) and a few others primarily detected in grassland/open field sites (e.g. American Kestrel, Tree Swallow) were <u> excluded from the trend analysis </u> since they do not breed in forested habitats.</b> We have provided estimates of their relative abundance and an analysis specific to the grassland obligate breeders is forthcoming. Trends were calculated for some species commonly detected in the grassland/open field sites (Red winged-black bird, Field Sparrow) that are closely associated with forested habitats such as forest edge, scrub, wetlands, and open woodlands, were detected at other park forests, and we could evaluate their abundance in the context of the surrounding forest habitat. Please see Doser et al. (2020) for further details of why certain species were excluded from the trend analysis.

#### Relative Abundance

<p>Relative abundance, expressed as the average of the maximum number of birds detected per site per year from `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear`, provides an indication of how often a particular species is observed during monitoring and reflects its population status in the park. Figure 7 shows that the most common species detected at `r params$Park` are a mix of species common to our region and of conservation importance.</p>

<p>

Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs) are ecologically distinct regions in North America with similar bird communities <a href="https://www.nabci-us.org/"> (www.nabci-us.org)</a>. `r params$Park` is located within the `r params$BCRName` BCR. Within this region, species of regional conservation importance have been designated based on rankings by Partners in Flight (Panjabi et al. 2020).

<strong> Twenty species of regional conservation concern within the `r params$BCRName` BCR have been detected at `r params$Park`</strong>, including American Kestrel, Barn Swallow, Black-billed Cuckoo, Belted Kingfisher, Bobolink, Brown Thrasher, Blue-winged Warbler, Eastern Kingbird, Eastern Meadowlark, Eastern Wood-Pewee, Field Sparrow, Golden-winged Warbler, Least Flycatcher, Northern Bobwhite, Northern Flicker, Northern Harrier, Rose-breasted Grosbeak, Veery, Vesper Sparrow, and Wood Thrush. Of these, 5 are among the 20 most abundant species detected (Figure 7)!

The rank order of abundance in the park is denoted in parentheses following the species name. Trend estimates represent the average change in abundance on the <b> log scale</b> of a species per site every <b> four years</b>.

##### <b>Top 10 Most Abundant Species at `r params$Park` </b>

<p>Figure 8 shows the trend estimates between `r params$minYear` and `r params$maxYear` for the top 10 most abundant species in `r params$Park` based on a model using time to first detection within the 10-minute point count (Doser et al. 2021). Note that trend estimates were derived from point count observations from forested and grassland/open field sites but excluded data for obligate grassland breeding species or other species primarily found in the grassland sites/open field habitats, which is why there are no trend presented for Bobolink and Tree Swallow. Average population size has not changed since `r params$minYear` for the 8 most commonly detected species we have estimates for (e.g., trend estimate error bars overlap zero) but there is an indication that detections of 5 species appear to be increasing since `r params$minYear`. American Crow and American Robin are the only common species showing non-significant increases. Refer to Figure 10 in the "Plots of Species Abundance" section to see annual counts over time for the common species and see Section "All Species Trends" to access the trends for all species by abundance ranking.</p>

<p>Of the 20 species that are of regional conservation importance at `r params$Park` and that we have trend estimates for, the relative abundance of Field Sparrow, Golden-winged Warbler, Least Flycatcher, Northern Flicker, Rose-breasted Grosbeak, Veery, Vesper Sparrow, and Wood Thrush has remained the same since `r params$minYear`. Over this same time period we have observed significant increases in Eastern Wood-Pewee (not all species shown in Figure 8).</p>

<p>

##### <b>Trends Across NETN Parks </b>

<p>The trend in abundance of all species combined across the network has not changed since 2006 (Figure 9a) but the trend varied widely across parks (Figure 9b). For instance, the abundance of all species combined has declined in 3 parks (ACAD, MABI, and MORR) while in SARA, ROVA, and WEFA it has increased over time. Abundance of all species detected in SAGA and MIMA remained the same during this time period.</p>

<p>In parks with a significant increasing trend in overall bird abundance, like `r params$Park`, most species generally showed a similar trend to the overall park trend, but often only a fraction of the species-specific trends were significantly different from zero. For example, while the trend analysis indicated that 67 species are increasing at `r params$Park`, only detections of 4 (Eastern Wood-Pewee, Gray Catbird, Red-Bellied Woodpecker, and White-breasted Nuthatch) have increased significantly since `r params$minYear` (Figures 8 and 9c). On the other hand, only four species at `r params$Park` were found to be in decline, but not significantly (American Crow, American Robin, Black-capped Chickadee, Hermit Thrush).</p>

Based on the comparisons of NETN monitoring results to the BBS survey data presented above it is clear that the majority of common species detected at `r params$Park` are in decline at the state or BCR scale but most of these species are stable at the park. The main exceptions being the widely distributed American Crow and American Robin which are declining in the park and declining significantly across the state and `r params$BCRName` BCR. While NETN's trend analysis did not include Bobolink or Tree Swallow, the plots of relative abundance seen in section "Plots of Species Abundance" do appear to be more or less stable whereas at the state of BCR scale these populations are declining significantly. Overall this comparison suggests that breeding populations of common species at `r params$Park` are not following regional patterns. In contrast, Eastern Wood-Pewee, Gray Catbird, Red-Bellied Woodpecker, and White-breasted Nuthatch, which are the only species that have increased significantly at the park since `r params$minYear` also appear to be stable or increasing at the state- and BCR-scale (not shown -- BBS data available at <https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/>).

Figure 11. Relationship between average number of birds of a single species per site (y-axis) and (a) tree basal area, (b) percent forest within a 1km radius around each site, and (c) forest regeneration. Site-level basal area and regeneration were estimated from NETN's long term forest health monitoring program (Tierney et al. 2017) and % Forest from the 2011 National Land Cover Database (Homer et al. 2015).
